### Key Points:
- Best practice assembly and polishing tools for Nanopore data include
   - [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye)
   - [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler)
   - [Miniasm](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm)
   - [Racon](https://github.com/isovic/racon)
   - [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu)
   - [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka)
   - [NanoPolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish)
   - [QUAST](https://quast.sourceforge.net/quast)

- *de novo* genome assembly involves assembling a genome from the raw reads without the aid of a reference genome as against a reference-based assembly which relies on a reference genome for alignment and subsequent assembly

:::
:::::


## 2.2.1 Background

There are two approaches for genome assembly: reference-based (or comparative)  or *de novo*.  In a reference-based assembly, we use a reference genome as a guide to map our sequence data to and thus reassemble our sequence this way (we will not do this here with our ONT data but will try it out with illumina data later on in the course). Alternatively, we can create a 'new' (*de novo*) assembly that does not rely on a map or reference and more closely reflects the actual genome structure of the isolate that was sequenced.

![Genome assembly](../fig/genome-assembly.jpeg)

### Genome assemblers

Several tools are available for *de novo* genome assembly depending on whether you're trying to assemble short-read sequence data, long reads or else a combination of both.  Three of the most commonly used assemblers for long read data are [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye), [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) and [Miniasm](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm).


Now that we have been able to see how **Quality** our Nanopore sequences are, we can can confidently proceed to assemble our bacterial genome. Here, we will perform long read assembly utilizing [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) in combination with [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka). Other useful tools for assembly includes [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) and [Miniasm](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm) in combination with [Racon](https://github.com/isovic/racon), or [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu). 
Another polishing tool in addition to [Medaka] is [NanoPolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) with Fast5 files.
Each of these tools, have their *pros and cons* but we will not go deep into them here.
Following the assembly, we will **QC** the products using [QUAST](https://quast.sourceforge.net/quast).


<details><summary>Disk Usage I --- Before analysis</summary>

Before we start performing any assemblies, let's pause and check the space of our current working directory as we did for our previous lesson.

You can do this with the **d**isk **u**sage `du` command

```bash
du -h
```

<details><summary>Current Disk Space In assembly_annotation_MTB Directory</summary>~247MB</details>

Now, keep this value in mind, and this time, don't forget it. We will come back to it at the end of this chapter.
</details>


## 2.2.2 Navigate to the `ONT` directory and activate the appropriate environment [`flye`, `medaka`, `quast`] as we go along
Note that, due to package conflicts, we are not currently able to place all of the above tools in the same conda environment.
Before we start, navigate into the `ONT/` directory and activate the `flye` environment:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/workshop_files_Bact_Genomics_2023/ONT/
```

```bash
mamba activate flye
```


## 2.2.3 Assembly and Genome Polishing

### *de novo* genome assembly with [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye)

`Flye` is a *de novo* assembler for single-molecule sequencing reads, such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete pipeline: it takes raw PacBio / ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs. Flye also has a special mode for metagenome assembly.

Nanopore assemblers are still in development, but **Flye** is a *de facto* standard.

## ***Exercise 2.2.1:*** Obtain statistics from `assembly.fasta` file.

1. What simple command can you use to have a peep into the `assembly.fasta` file by looking at only the first 10 lines.

2. What quick command can you use to count all the lines and letters in the `assembly.fasta` file.

3. With one line of command, how would you determine the number of contigs present in the `assembly.fasta` file.

Report on your findings. How do they varry from the information contained in the `assembly_info.txt` file.

To view the last 10 lines
```bash
tail -n 10 assembly.fasta
```

2.
```bash
wc assembly.fasta

Before we move on to the next step, let's rename our assembly (`assembly.fasta`) to something more meaningful `barcode30_assembly.fasta` and copy it to the current directory.

How do we do this?

### genome polishing with [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka)

Now that we are done with `flye`, let's deactivate the `flye` environment and activate our `medaka` environment.


```bash
mamba deactivate
```

```bash
mamba activate medaka
```


**Medaka** is an assembly polisher and variant caller made by ONT and used to create consensus sequences and variant calls from nanopore sequencing data. It is the recommended polisher for Flye assemblies. The **Medaka** [documentation](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) mentions that it has specifically been trained on **Flye** output (it is an ML-based tool).

**Medaka** requires only basecalled data --- `.fasta` or `.fastq` and it is 50X faster than Nanopolish.

If Medaka runs out of memory, add option `-b 80` to the command-line. If it still runs out of memory, reduce the 80 further until it doesn’t.

:::


Just like we did for the `assembly.fasta` file generated from `flye`, let's rename the `consensus.fasta` file to a more meaningful name.

:::{.callout}
# Rename consensus file and copy to current directory

```bash
cp barcode30_medaka/consensus.fasta barcode30_polished_assembly.fasta
```
:::


:::{.callout-important}
# Setting the righ **model** `-m`.

For best results it is important to specify the correct model, `-m` in the above command we just run, according to the basecaller used. Allowed values can be found by running `medaka tools list\_models`.

Medaka models are named to indicate 

 - the pore type, 
 - the sequencing device (MinION or PromethION), 
 - the basecaller variant, 
 - the basecaller version, with the format:

```
{pore}_{device}_{caller variant}_{caller version}
```

For example the model named **r941_min_fast_g303** should be used with data from MinION (or GridION) R9.4.1 flowcells using the fast Guppy basecaller version 3.0.3. By contrast the model **r941_prom_hac_g303** should be used with PromethION data and the high accuracy basecaller (termed "hac" in Guppy configuration files). Where a version of Guppy has been used without an exactly corresponding medaka model, the medaka model with the highest version equal to or less than the guppy version should be selected.

:::


:::{.callout-note}
# Bacterial (ploidy-1) variant calling

Note that we can perform variant calling with medaka. Variant calling for monoploid samples is enabled through the `medaka_haploid_variant` workflow:

```bash
medaka_haploid_variant -i <reads.fastq> -r <ref.fasta>
```

This requires the reads as a `.fasta` or `.fastq` and a reference sequence as a `.fasta` file.

## 2.2.4 Assembly quality assessment with [`QUAST`](https://quast.sourceforge.net/)

Now that we are done with `medaka`, let's deactivate the `medaka` environment and activate our `quast` environment.


```bash
mamba deactivate
```

```bash
mamba activate quast
```

![Genome assembly evaluation tool](../fig/quast_logo_black.png)

Before we do any further analyses with our assemblies, we need to assess the quality. To do this we use a tool called `QUAST`. **QUAST** stands for **QU**ality **AS**sessment **T**ool. It evaluates genome/metagenome assemblies by computing and generating various metrics for assemblies.  

These include but aren't limited to:

1. The total number of contigs greater than 0 bp.  Ideally, we like to see assemblies in the smallest number of contigs ('pieces') as this means there is likely less missing data contained in gaps between contigs.
2. The total length of the assembly.  We normally know what the expected length of our assembly is (for more diverse organisms like *E. coli* there may be a range of genome sizes). The length of your assembly should be close to the expected genome size.  If it's too big or too small, either there is some kind of contamination or else you've sequenced the wrong species!
3. The **N50** of the assembly.  This is the final metric often used to assess the quality of an assembly.  The N50 is typically calculated by averaging the length of the largest contigs that account for 50% of the genome size. This is a bit more complicated conceptually but the higher the N50 the better. A large N50 implies that you have a small number of larger contigs in your assembly which equals a good assembly.

We will run `quast` in the same *assembly* environment.

    --min-identity <float>            The minimum alignment identity (80.0, 100.0) [default: 95.0]
-a  --ambiguity-usage <none|one|all>  Use none, one, or all alignments of a contig when all of them
                                      are almost equally good (see --ambiguity-score) [default: one]
    --ambiguity-score <float>         Score S for defining equally good alignments of a single contig. All alignments are sorted 
                                      by decreasing LEN * IDY% value. All alignments with LEN * IDY% < S * best(LEN * IDY%) are 
                                      discarded. S should be between 0.8 and 1.0 [default: 0.99]
    --strict-NA                       Break contigs in any misassembly event when compute NAx and NGAx.
                                      By default, QUAST breaks contigs only by extensive misassemblies (not local ones)
-x  --extensive-mis-size  <int>       Lower threshold for extensive misassembly size. All relocations with inconsistency
                                      less than extensive-mis-size are counted as local misassemblies [default: 1000]
    --scaffold-gap-max-size  <int>    Max allowed scaffold gap length difference. All relocations with inconsistency
                                      less than scaffold-gap-size are counted as scaffold gap misassemblies [default: 10000]
    --unaligned-part-size  <int>      Lower threshold for detecting partially unaligned contigs. Such contig should have
                                      at least one unaligned fragment >= the threshold [default: 500]
    --skip-unaligned-mis-contigs      Do not distinguish contigs with >= 50% unaligned bases as a separate group
                                      By default, QUAST does not count misassemblies in them
    --fragmented                      Reference genome may be fragmented into small pieces (e.g. scaffolded reference) 
    --fragmented-max-indent  <int>    Mark translocation as fake if both alignments are located no further than N bases 
                                      from the ends of the reference fragments [default: 85]
                                      Requires --fragmented option
    --upper-bound-assembly            Simulate upper bound assembly based on the reference genome and reads
    --upper-bound-min-con  <int>      Minimal number of 'connecting reads' needed for joining upper bound contigs into a scaffold
                                      [default: 2 for mate-pairs and 1 for long reads]
    --est-insert-size  <int>          Use provided insert size in upper bound assembly simulation [default: auto detect from reads or 255]
    --plots-format  <str>             Save plots in specified format [default: pdf].
                                      Supported formats: emf, eps, pdf, png, ps, raw, rgba, svg, svgz
    --memory-efficient                Run everything using one thread, separately per each assembly.
                                      This may significantly reduce memory consumption on large genomes
    --space-efficient                 Create only reports and plots files. Aux files including .stdout, .stderr, .coords will not be created.
                                      This may significantly reduce space consumption on large genomes. Icarus viewers also will not be built

### ***Exercise 2.2.2:*** Investigate the QUAST output
Now that we've got the results from `QUAST`, how good is the assembly we created with `flye` and polished with `medaka`?

1. What is the total number of contigs?
2. What is the total length of the assembly?
3. What is the N50 of the assembly?
4. What is the %GC content?
5. Have a look at the `report.html` and `report.pdf`files

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
### ***Solution:***
There are a couple of ways we could answer the questions above as the assembly metrics can be parsed in different ways.  Let's parse the `report.tsv`:

```bash
cat quast/report.tsv
```

This will provide all the information we need:

```
Assembly	barcode30_polished_assembly
# contigs (>= 0 bp)	14
# contigs (>= 1000 bp)	13
# contigs (>= 5000 bp)	12
# contigs (>= 10000 bp)	7
# contigs (>= 25000 bp)	6
# contigs (>= 50000 bp)	4
Total length (>= 0 bp)	5550020
Total length (>= 1000 bp)	5549509
Total length (>= 5000 bp)	5544902
Total length (>= 10000 bp)	5507314
Total length (>= 25000 bp)	5489744
Total length (>= 50000 bp)	5400737
# contigs	14
Largest contig	3514823
Total length	5550020
GC (%)	50.53
N50	3514823
N90	1663737
auN	2730259.6
L50	1
L90	2
# N's per 100 kbp	0.00

```

1. The total number of contigs > 0bp is `14`
2. The total length of the assembly is `5550020`
3. The N50 of the assembly is `3514823`
4. The %GC content is 50.53%

What do you think? Should we move forward with this assembly?

:::::

Finally, deactivate the `quast` environment:

```bash
mamba deactivate
```

## ***Exercise 2.2.3:*** Running a bash script on all five samples and providing a MultiQC summary

Have a quick look at the bash script `assembly_ont.sh`.
Run the script and report on your findings.

:::{.callout collapse="true"}
## ***Solution:***

We will run the bash script with the command below:

```bash
bash assembly_ont.sh
```

<details><summary>Disk Usage II --- Cleaning up after analysis</summary>
Now that we are done investigating our assembling and annotating our genome, let's pause again and check the space of our current working directory.

You can do this with the **d**isk **u**sage `du` command
```bash
du -h
```

How much disk space have you used since the start of the analysis?

</details>
